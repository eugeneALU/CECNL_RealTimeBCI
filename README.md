# File description

## Blinking_window.py
- Create a window that shows the blinking indicators
- <span style="color:blue">Some core parameters</span>:
    - **frequency** : Control the frequency of the indicators
    - **POINTS** : Control the position of the indicators
    - **FrameRate** : The frame rate of your monitor (higher might be better) 

## fbcca.py
- Conduct Filter Bank CCA
- Main function : <span style="color:red">**fbcca_realtime**</span>, slightly different version since we don't conduct the fbcca in real-time. 
- <span style="color:blue">Core parameters</span>: 
    - **THRESHOLD** : Define different threshold of different subjects, since different people might have a different response to the stimulus 
- Reference Github: https://github.com/mnakanishi/TRCA-SSVEP

## Tello3.py
- interface to the Drone 
- just use it!
- API Reference : *Reference/Tello SDK Documentation.pdf*

## Main.py
- Main function of the application
- <span style="color:blue">Core parameters</span>: 
    - Threshold : The threshold that controls how many time a certain command should accumulate before send out to the drone
    - BUFFER_SIZE : Size of the buffers
    - Filter : You can design your own filters
        - power_line_frequency : target of the notch filter

## ReceiveData.py
- Now we receive the data from LSL protocol. But we might get it directly from the USB port through Cygnus_Kernel they build. However, the function is still under construction.
- Kernel Reference: *Reference/API_V0.10.8.pdf*

# Instruction for running the system

1. Install
<pre>pip install -r requirement.txt</pre>
2. Connect to the TELLO Wifi
    1. Boot the drone
    2. Find the wifi (as shown below), and connect to that one to order the drone 
    ![WIFI](./fig/WIFI.png)
3. Open LSL data stream
    1. Open Cygnus
    2. Connect the device then data stream will be available
    ![LSL](./fig/LSL.png)
4. Open Blinking Window in one command window
<pre>python Blinking_window.py</pre>
5. Open another CMD window and start main program
    1. <pre>python main.py</pre>
    2. The snapshot of the execution of the program
    ![MAIN](./fig/MAIN.png)
6. <span style="color:red">CHECK!!!</span>
    - The Wifi of the TELLO will close once there's no any command in around 15 seconds, so check which wifi currently connected
    - Make sure you receive **ok** as a response from the drone to ensure the drone is connected.
    - Ctrl+C to end the program and the drone will land 
    - Ignore the error(200)
    - All shown as below:
    ![OK](./fig/OK.png)
